# PPM Data Import Error Analysis

## Summary
- **Total Records Processed**: 920 (533 imported + 191 skipped + 196 errors)
- **Successfully Imported**: 533 records (58%)
- **Skipped**: 191 records (21%)
- **Errors**: 196 records (21%)

## Error Categories

### 1. Missing Required Fields
Several records were skipped due to missing required fields:

- **Missing MFG_SERIAL** (15 records)
  - Rows: 175, 183, 222, 323, 330, 334, 434, 461, 468, 485, 528, 544, 547, 576, 611, 614
  - The MFG_SERIAL field is mandatory for all equipment records and cannot be empty
  - **Solution**: Ensure all equipment has a valid MFG_SERIAL value

- **Missing Q1 Date** (7 records)
  - Rows: 2, 80, 81, 82, 83, 106, 620
  - PPM records require a valid Q1 date to generate the maintenance schedule
  - **Solution**: Add a valid date in DD/MM/YYYY format for Q1

### 2. Date Format Errors
The majority of errors were related to date format issues:

- **Invalid Month Value** (164 records)
  - Error: "month must be in 1..12"
  - This occurs when the date has an invalid month value (must be 1-12)
  - Affected rows include: 107-145, 356-399, 651-730, and many others
  - **Solution**: Ensure dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format with valid month values

- **Invalid Day Value** (5 records)
  - Error: "day is out of range for month"
  - Rows: 343-347
  - This occurs when the day value exceeds the maximum days in the specified month
  - **Solution**: Ensure the day value is valid for the given month

### 3. Duplicate Entries
Some records were replaced because they had the same MFG_SERIAL as existing entries:

- **Replaced Existing Entries** (5 records)
  - Rows: 56, 321, 452, 493, 570
  - MFG_SERIALs: '560027-M1962180003', '1.20E+11', '101069456', 'GB17298-B', 'WU202202001EN'
  - These weren't errors but notifications that duplicate entries were updated
  - **Solution**: No action needed unless unintentional duplicates

## Additional Issue: Missing Edit Functionality
After import, the system reported an error when trying to display the equipment list:

```
Error loading ppm list: Could not build url for endpoint 'views.edit_ppm_equipment' with values ['mfg_serial']. Did you mean 'views.add_ppm_equipment' instead?
```

This indicates that the `edit_ppm_equipment` route is missing in the application. The template is trying to create edit links for PPM equipment, but the corresponding route doesn't exist.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Date Formats**:
   - Ensure all dates in the CSV file are in DD/MM/YYYY format
   - Check for invalid month values (must be 1-12)
   - Check for invalid day values (must be valid for the given month)

2. **Add Missing Required Fields**:
   - Ensure all records have a valid MFG_SERIAL
   - Ensure all PPM records have a valid Q1 date

3. **Implement Edit Functionality**:
   - Add the missing `edit_ppm_equipment` route to fix the equipment list display

4. **Data Validation Before Import**:
   - Consider implementing a pre-validation step that checks the CSV file for common errors before attempting to import
   - Provide more detailed error messages to help users correct their data

5. **Template Improvements**:
   - Download a fresh template from the system
   - Use the template as a guide for formatting your data correctly
   - Consider using Excel data validation to enforce correct date formats

## Sample of Valid Record Format

For PPM records, ensure your data follows this format:

```
EQUIPMENT,MODEL,MFG_SERIAL,MANUFACTURER,LOG_NO,DEPARTMENT,PPM,PPM Q I,Q1_ENGINEER,PPM Q II,Q2_ENGINEER,PPM Q III,Q3_ENGINEER,PPM Q IV,Q4_ENGINEER
Ventilator,XYZ-100,SN12345,Medical Systems Inc,LOG001,LDR,Yes,01/01/2024,John Doe,01/04/2024,Jane Smith,01/07/2024,John Doe,01/10/2024,Jane Smith
```

Key points:
- MFG_SERIAL must be unique and non-empty
- PPM Q I date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format
- Other quarters will be auto-generated but can be specified
- PPM value must be 'Yes' or 'No'
